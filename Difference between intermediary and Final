The call to the filter method is lazy.
When we invoke the method its just the declartion of the statement.
An operation on a stream that returns a Stream is called an intermediary operation.

peek() --> returns the stream.(Intermediary Operation)
forEach() --> doesnot return anything.(Final Operation)

Only the final operation will trigger the processing of the data in Stream.
