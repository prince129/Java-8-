Mapping Operation

map() -- returns a Stream therefore intermediary operation.

one abstract method in interface Function

--> R apply(T t);
default 

--> compose
--> andThen

Static 

--> identity

Another Method
	flatMap();

Signature: 
	
	<R> Stream<R> flatmap(Function<T, Stream<R>> flatMapper);

	<R> Stream<R> map(Function<T, R> mapper);

	If the flatMap was a regular map, it would return a 	Stream<Stream<R>>
	But it is a flatMap
	Thus the Stream of Stream is flattened to become a Stream.
