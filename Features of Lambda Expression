Question 1 : What is the type of Lamda Expression in Java 8 ?
Answer : Lamda Expression is called the Functional Interface.
         A functional Interface is an Interface with only one abstract method.
         Runnable Interface and Comperator Interface are example of Functional Interface
         Methods from Object classes is not counted in Functional Interface.
         Functional Interface can be annoted. @FunctionalInterface is new annotation used for annoating the functioncal interface.
Question 2 : Can a lamda be put in a variable?
Answer : Yes.
         Comparator<String> c = (String s1, String s2) -> 
                                        Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length());
                                        
         A lambda can be taken as a method parameter, and can be returned by a method.
