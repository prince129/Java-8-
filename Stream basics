 What is stream?

	Stream is a Java typed interface.
	It gives ways to efficiently process large amounts of data 	and smaller ones too.

	It can process data in parallel.

	An object on which one can define operations.

	An object that does not hold any data.

	An object that should not change the data it processes.

	An object able to process data in <<one pass>>

	All the processing of data is done in the pipeline.

	
Why can't a collection be a stream?

Because Stream is a new concept, and we dont want to change the Collection API works.

How to Build Stream.

List<Person> person = ...;

Stream<Person> stream = person.stream();

stream.forEach(p -> System.out.println(p));


Chain Consumers
	
	List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
	
	Consumer<String> c1 = s -> list.add(s);
	Consumer<String> c2 = s -> System.out.println(s);

	Consumer<String> c3 = c1.andThen(c2);

	person.stream().forEach(c1.andThen(c2));
