Collectors
	mutable reduction.
	Instead of aggregating elements, this reduction put them in 	a << container >>

	String  == Collectors.joining(", ")
	List == Collectors.tiList()
	Map == Collectors.groupingBy(Person::getAge)
	
		keys of this map will we age of peron and values 		will be the person object itself.

DownStream Collectors
	
	Collectors.counting() just counts the number of people of 	each age.
	
	** We cant perform two final operation on single Stream.
	
	Map<Integer, Long> map = 
	persons.stream()
		.collect(
			Collectors.groupingBy(
				person::getAge,
				Collectors.counting() // downstream counting if not define the value of the map will be the Person object with key as integer of age
				)		
		);
